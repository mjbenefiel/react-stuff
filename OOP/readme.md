Object Oriented JavaScript

- Object in JS is quite like objects in real life (IE, a car)
- They have properties and things they can do (methods)
- Methods
    - Functions associated with the object

- Classes emulate the idea of classes in JS
    - under the hood, classes are doing the same thing as the prototype model
- Classes are like blueprints that describes a particular object in a non-specific way (Car class, color)(User class that has email, name status, login() logout())
- Constructor Function is the function that actually constructs the object
- The 'new' keyword
    - creates a new empty object{}
    - set the value of 'this' to be the new empty object
    - calls the constructor method
