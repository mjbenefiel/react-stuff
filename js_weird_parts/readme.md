JavaScript -- Understanding the Weird Parts

IIFEs - Section 4.44

Closures - Section 4.46

- execution context has closed in its outer variables
- closures are a feature of JS -- they happen 
- JS engine creates the closure, we're taking advantage of the feature

Object Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance - Section 5.53

- Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance
    - Inheritance
        - One object gets access to properties and methods of another object
    - all objects have a prototype property
        - the property is a reference to another object (proto)
- prototype chain
    - where we have access to a property or method amongst a sequence of objects that are connected via the proto property
- Special reference in object that says where to look for other properties and methods - that's the prototype.
