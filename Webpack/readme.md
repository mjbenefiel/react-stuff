Webpack 

  Webpack takes all of our assets and outputs them to a production-ready bundle

   - Bundles JavaScript files into one file, minimizing http requests
   - Process SASS / LESS files into CSS and only use them where needed
   - Convert JSX or ES2015 into vanilla JS which browsers understand

  Considerations for Webpack use
   - Bundle speed (Webpack faster)
   - Bundle size (Webpack bigger in size than Browserify)
   - Difficulty of configuration (Webpack easier to configure)

  webpack-dev-server
    - Automatically takes care of changes
