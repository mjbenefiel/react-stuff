# Debug Example Demo

This is a demonstration on how to use debugging tools in Visual Studio Code. This project currently has bugs that have been left there intentionally. The fixes have been provided in branches `places-fix` for Places code and `client-fix` for the client-side code.

The article that goes along with this project can be found on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com). The article is titled [**A Guide to Debugging a JavaScript Project Using VS Code and the Chrome Debugger**.](https://www.sitepoint.com/debugging-javascript-projects-vs-code-chrome-debugger/)

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Install mocha globally: `npm install -g mocha`
4. To run tests, `npm test`
5. To run the client-side, you need to start express server by `npm start` and opening the url [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

<strong>Notes</strong>
- Drag Dots anchor: for moving the toolbar to somewhere itâ€™s not blocking anything
- Continue: continue the debugging session
- Step over: execute code line by line, skipping functions
- Step into: execute code line by line, going inside functions
- Step out: if already inside a function, this command will take you out
- Restart: restarts the debugging session
- Stop: stops the debugging session.

- Variables: displays local and global variables within the current scope (i.e. at the point of execution)
- Watch: you can manually add expressions of variables you want to monitor
- Call Stack: displays a call stack of the highlighted code
- Breakpoints: displays a list of files with breakpoints, along with their line numbers.
